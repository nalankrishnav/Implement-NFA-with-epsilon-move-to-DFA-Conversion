# üîÅ Epsilon-NFA to DFA Conversion using Python and Graphviz

This project implements the conversion of a **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)** with **epsilon (Œµ) transitions** into an equivalent **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** using Python. It visualizes both the E-NFA and resulting DFA using the `graphviz` library for clear graphical representation.

## üéØ Objective

To automate the **subset construction algorithm** for Œµ-NFA to DFA conversion, which is crucial in compiler design and lexical analysis for transforming ambiguous state machines into deterministic ones.

## üß† Concept Overview

1. **Epsilon Closure Calculation**:
   - For each state, compute the set of states reachable via epsilon (Œµ) transitions.

2. **Subset Construction**:
   - Begin with the Œµ-closure of the start state.
   - For each DFA state and input symbol, compute the union of Œµ-closures of transitions from all included NFA states.

3. **Final States**:
   - Any DFA state containing at least one NFA final state is marked as a DFA final state.

4. **Dead State (œï)**:
   - Transitions that result in no reachable state are routed to a universal dead state œï.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Takes input from the user: states, alphabets, transitions (including epsilon 'e'), and final states.
- Constructs an internal transition table using dictionaries.
- Uses BFS-like logic to explore all reachable combinations (subsets of NFA states) and form DFA states.
- Renders both the E-NFA and DFA using **Graphviz** as `.pdf` or `.png` files.
